# /setstack

**Minimum Version: NONE**  
**(O) Permission:** `estools.setstack`  
```
/setstack <amount>
```
**Player only command**

Changes the amount of items in the currently held itemstack to the amount specified.
Please note that most modern versions of Minecraft are unable to display amounts above 127 and
the item will seem to disappear, the item with however still be in your inventory and can still
be used which can cause unwanted buggy behaviour.

This command does not impose limitations on the *amount* argument except that it must be a valid
32-bit signed integer.
