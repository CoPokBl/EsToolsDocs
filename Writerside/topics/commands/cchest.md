**(N) Permission:** `estools.cchest.creative`  
```
/cchest
```

Opens up the current player's creative chest. To open the CChest in creative mode,
you need the `estools.cchest.creative` permission node. To do it in any other game mode,
you need the `estools.cchest.survival` permission node. Be aware that `estools.cchest.creative`
is granted by default but does not give more functionality than the vanilla client does.

The creative chest is an inventory per player that allows you to store items, it 
is particularly useful for items with complicated custom data, like enchantments and lore.

To place an item in the inventory, click an item from your player inventory and then place
it in the CChest by left-clicking on the slot you wish to use. You can then copy an item from
the CChest by left-clicking on the item you wish to copy from the CChest while not holding
another item, you can then place it in your player inventory. To delete an item from the CChest,
right-click the item in the CChest.
