# /warp

**Minimum Version: NONE**  
**(O) Permission:** `estools.warps.use`
```
/warp <warpname>
```
**Player only command**

Teleports the executor to the specified warp that was set with /warps.
The command will only tab complete global warps you have permission
for, and local warps that are in the same world as you and that you
have permission for. Specifying a warp that doesn't exist or that
you don't permission for will yield a warp not found error message.
If you have permission for it, you may specify a local warp
from a world you aren't in, it just won't tab complete.

See [/warps](warps.md) for information on configuring warps.
