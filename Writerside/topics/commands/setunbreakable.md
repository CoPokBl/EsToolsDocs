# /setunbreakable

**Minimum Version: 1.1**  
**(O) Permission:** `estools.setunbreakable`  
```
/setunbreakable
```
**Player only command**

Toggles whether the executor's held item is unbreakable.
Unbreakable items don't lose durability and when items are made unbreakable they regain their
durability.

In Minecraft 1.11+ this gives the item the `unbreakable` flag. On versions below 1.11
the enchantment `unbreaking 32767` is added to the item.
