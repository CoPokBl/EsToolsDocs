# /infinite

**Minimum Version: 1.1**  
**(O) Permission:** `estools.infinite`  
```
/infinite
```
**Player only command**  

Toggles infinite block mode for the executor. While in infinite block mode when players place blocks
they will be given back the blocks they place. If you intend to place a lot of blocks quickly,
for example when bridging, then it is recommended to have at least 5 of the block you wish to place
to account for ping making the block be given back slower.

This command allows players to dupe blocks and should not be given to regular survival players.
