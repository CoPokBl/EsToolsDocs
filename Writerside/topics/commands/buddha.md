/buddha [entity] [time]
```

Toggles Buddha mode for the specified entity for the specified amount of time in seconds. 
In Buddha mode when entities take a lethal hit they don't die, their health overflows back to full. 
This is helpful if you still want to take damage but just not die.
Entity defaults to the executor. Console must specify entity.
Time defaults to forever. After the specified time has elapsed Buddha mode is disabled for the entity.
