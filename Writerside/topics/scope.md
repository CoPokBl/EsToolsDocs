# Project Scope
We have a vision for what EsTools is supposed to be.
Some plugins, like EssentialsX include features like economy
which we feel should be handled by a separate plugin
so that the server owner has more control over how their server
runs. We don't want to force people to use a specific economy 
system, for to use our commands. So the only commands we will
add are simply just useful server management tools. We will
also **NEVER** override vanilla commands.

## Specific Things To Not Add
- Economy
- Moderation (ban and kick commands)
- Region protection
