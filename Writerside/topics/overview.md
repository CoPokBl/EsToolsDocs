# EsTools
A general purpose Essentials like plugin with everything you need but not messing up anything (MC 1.0+)

EsTools is a plugin designed to be like EssentialsX in that it provides heaps of
helpful commands, but unlike essentials it doesn't mess up or override vanilla features (e.g. the give command).
This plugin doesn't override existing Minecraft commands and therefore is less likely to mess stuff up.
EsTools is also completely `/reload` safe.
